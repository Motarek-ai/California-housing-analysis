# California Housing Data Analysis

This is my first data science project, created as part of my learning journey with Eng. Ahmed Madah at Kayan.  
The goal of this project is to analyze the California Housing dataset and build a simple Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.

## Project Overview

The project covers the full data analysis workflow:
1. Importing Libraries – NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
2. Loading the Dataset – Using fetch_california_housing() from Scikit-learn  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding data structure and relationships  
4. Data Visualization – Creating plots to explore correlations and trends  
5. Model Training – Building a Linear Regression model  
6. Model Evaluation – Using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R² Score  

## Key Learnings

- How to work with real-world datasets  
- Understanding regression models  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Visualizing data effectively  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Results

The project demonstrates how linear regression can be used to make predictions on housing data and evaluate the accuracy of the model.
